## I'm Nathan Saritzky, a programmer, problem solver, runner, and lapsed mathematician.

Up until 2018, I had spent my post-college (and in-college) life working towards a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry. After a few years at the University of Washington, I realized that it wasn't for me. I enjoy learning broadly, and an academic career is about learning a very narrow slice of something. I want a good, stable career, a luxury many postdocs never find. And while it can be great to feel invested in my work, I want to be able to engage with the rest of my life without feeling guilty that I'm not doing research.

Since then, I've turned my attention away from pure mathematics and towards software development. I've spent my entire adult life learning to solve difficult, abstract problems. Now I have a chance to combine that with my broader interests and to enter new areas that, before, I didn't have the time or space for. Here is where I plan to share the results.

When I'm not working, I like to run (slowly, and for a long time) and play [Go][] (also slowly). I'm working hard to improve at both, and both serve as inspirations for my personal projects.
