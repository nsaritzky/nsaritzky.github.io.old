Every week, a few times a week, I go for a run with the [Seattle Green Lake Running Group][SGLRG]. Like most members of the group, I post my runs to [Strava][], a tool for recording, analyzing, and sharing athletic activities. This allows, afterwards, for a great deal of mileage and pace tracking, checking who was with you (the groups often have dozens of runners), and exchanging of enthusiastic notes about how fast everyone went and the extent to which they Crushed It. Many people take the small step of renaming their activity to its name on our Meetup page, e.g. the run starting from Starbuck's at 5:30am (yes, 5:30am) on Wednesday is renamed to "Wake-up Wednesday". I rarely took the time to do this, though, preferring instead to spend my time looking at all the fun graphs my runs generated.

Occasionally, it would come to my mind that it'd be nice if Strava would name them automatically. Allowing a user to set naming rules based on, say, the starting time and location, felt pretty straightforward.

In 2018, I decided to stop pursuing a career in pure mathematics. This meant shifting my focus from log-canonical singularties and the minimal model program to shoring up my programming skills. It was an immediate breath of fresh air, as it had been some time since I had really enjoyed my work. After a few weeks of reading and coding exercises, I wanted a project to build. Something that would give me a goal to aim for, as well as show anybody who might hire me that I'm more than a head-in-the-clouds mathematician. Adding that missing feature to Strava seemed like a good start, being both a tangible product and an achievable goal. 

The difficulty of making it fell, predictably, somewhere between what I'd expected and what I'd feared. Along the way, I learned a lot about Python, web frameworks, libraries, version control, and deployment. Pure math doesn't offer many opportunities to *make* things, and I found it all very satisfying. The result is [Greenamer][], and it looks like this:

I've also found that the experience has changed my relationship with the web. Before, it always felt like someone else's space that I was occupying, subject to their choices and inclinations. Now, it feels like something *I* have some power over. When something is suboptimal, or broken, or missing, instead of being something I just have to deal with, it's an opportunity to explore, learn, and change something.
